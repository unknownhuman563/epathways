/**
 * Server-side drafts for the five public visa intakes (Resident, Work, Student,
 * Visitor, Family).
 *
 * Those forms only ever auto-saved to the applicant's own localStorage, so a
 * half-filled assessment was invisible to staff — the Visa Assessment dashboard
 * showed nothing until final submit, and an applicant who abandoned the form
 * simply vanished.
 *
 * Drafts land as a `Lead` rather than a partial row in the intake table on
 * purpose: `resident_intakes` alone has 23 NOT NULL columns with no default
 * (passport number, arrival date, hourly rate …), none of which a draft has
 * yet. Storing there would mean making them all nullable across five tables and
 * weakening the real submit's guarantees. A Lead already carries name/email/
 * phone as first-class columns and has a JSON bucket for the rest, and it is
 * the same shape the Free Assessment funnel has always used for its drafts —
 * so these appear in the very same list, under the right visa tab.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the intake tables, and a draft never becomes a
 * submission: the real `store()` path is untouched.
