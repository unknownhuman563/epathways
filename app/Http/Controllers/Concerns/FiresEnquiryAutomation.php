/**
 * Fires the configurable "New enquiry captured" email automation
 * (`immigration.lead.captured`) when a client submits a visa assessment on the
 * public site.
 *
 * The visa-interest funnel stores an Intake (+ a tracking Assessment) but NOT a
 * Lead — a Lead is only created later at Convert-to-Case. So we build a
 * transient (unsaved) Lead purely to carry the applicant's contact details and
 * visa type into the notification's template variables. Every lead_id-scoped
 * lookup inside CommunicationService then simply resolves to empty, and staff
 * recipients fall back to the practice's default adviser/manager — correct for a
 * brand-new enquiry that has no assigned case yet.
 *
 * EmailAutomationService::fire() is a safe no-op unless an admin has enabled a
 * message for this event, and it never throws, so this can never break submit.
