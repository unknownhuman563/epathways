/**
 * When a public visa assessment is submitted by someone who is ALREADY an
 * immigration case (matched on email), sync the fresh submission into that
 * existing case instead of leaving a disconnected duplicate.
 *
 * A submission never creates a Lead of its own (the Lead only exists once the
 * enquiry was converted to a case), so without this a returning client's new
 * form lands as an orphan intake/assessment with no link to the case they are
 * already being handled under. Here we copy their latest personal + visa
 * details onto the case and point the case at this newest assessment.
 *
 * Runs after the intake has been committed and never throws — a sync failure
 * must not turn a saved submission into a user-facing error.
