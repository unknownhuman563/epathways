| On-page SEO configuration
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Central, maintainable source of per-page SEO metadata. Resolved at request
| time by App\Support\Seo and rendered server-side in resources/views/app.blade.php,
| so every public URL advertises its own <title>, meta description, canonical,
| Open Graph and Twitter tags plus structured data — without touching each
| controller or page component.
|
| Canonical / OG URLs are always built from the fixed canonical base
| (config('app.canonical_url'), default https://luvep.com), never the request
| host, so staging / localhost / the old domain can never leak into metadata.
|
| To add SEO for a new public page: add one entry to the 'pages' map keyed by
| its path (leading slash; '/' is the homepage). Dynamic pages (programme
| details) are handled by App\Support\Seo::forProgram().
