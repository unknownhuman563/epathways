    | Restricted modules
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Modules listed here are HIDDEN by default and must be granted per-user by
    | a super admin from Module Management. Super admins always see them.
    |
    | Every module that already exists in the app is GRANDFATHERED — it is NOT
    | listed here, so it stays visible exactly as it is today (role-based). Only
    | add a module here when it should ship hidden-by-default until granted.
    |
    | Keyed by a stable module key (used on the users.module_permissions array
    | and on the frontend nav item's `module` field).
    |
    | A module may expose `features` — grantable SUB-PARTS. A grant may then be
    | the whole module key (`dtr`, implies every feature) or a dotted feature
    | key (`dtr.reports`). `admin_default: true` marks a module admins + super
    | admins always see (it was historically an admin surface); such a module is
    | additionally grantable to non-admin staff. Without it, only super admins
    | see the module until granted (agents, program_verification).
