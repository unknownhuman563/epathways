# ePathways — Users, Roles & Features

**Reference document** · generated from source (`app/Models/User.php`, `EnsurePortalAccess`, portal layouts, `routes/web.php`)
**Last updated:** 2026-07-21

This document lists every user role in the system, what each can access, and the features available in each portal. It is the authoritative "who can do what" reference.

---

## 1. How access works (in one minute)

- Every user has a single **`role`** column. There is no multi-role assignment — one account, one role.
- After login, a user lands on their **home route** (`User::homeRoute()`) and can only reach areas their role permits.
- Route protection is the **`portal:<role>`** middleware. Listing several roles means "any of these" (OR). Example: `portal:admin,immigration` = admins **or** immigration staff.
- **Admins and super-admins pass every portal check** — they can open any department's screens. `super_admin`-only surfaces (Super Dashboard, Maintenance Mode) are the exception: plain admins are kept out by an exact-role check.

## 2. Current accounts in this system

| # | Role | Name | Email |
|---|------|------|-------|
| 1 | `super_admin` | Admin | support@epathways.co.nz |
| 2 | `finance` | Finance | finance@epathways.co.nz |
| 3 | `education` | Bryle | educ@epathways.co.nz |
| 5 | `agent` | lilian | lilian@gmail.com |

*4 accounts total. New staff accounts are created in **Admin → User Management**; external client accounts are created through the **Portal Invitation** flow (Sales requests → Admin approves → credentials generated).*

## 3. The role hierarchy

12 roles exist, in 4 tiers. "Rank" is the numeric power weight used by `isAtLeast()`.

## 5. Notes & gotchas

- **One role per account.** To give someone broader access, use `admin` (all departments) rather than stacking roles.
- **Admins see everything**, so a bug or destructive action reachable in one department is reachable by every admin — worth remembering when auditing.
- **`immigration_adviser` is read-only by design** but sits in a role group that reaches some destructive routes; the actual block is server-side policy. (Flagged separately in the route/bug audits.)
- **Some `/admin/immigration/...` screens are shared** between admins and immigration staff (`portal:admin,immigration`); the immigration portal deep-links into them.
- **Agents and Leads are external** — they only ever see their own data.
